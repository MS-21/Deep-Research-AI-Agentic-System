# Deep-Research-AI-Agentic-System
## Overview
The Deep Research AI Agentic System is a dual-agent system designed to crawl websites, gather information, and generate a comprehensive, well-structured answer based on the data collected. The system uses LangChain and Groq to organize, analyze, and generate insights from the collected data. The system is split into two main agents:
1. Research Agent: Focused on crawling websites and collecting research data.
2. Answer Drafter Agent: Processes the collected data and drafts a well-structured answer based on the findings.
